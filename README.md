# Illager Expansion
Original credit goes to [OhDrincky](https://github.com/OhDricky) for this modpack.

This modpack is a fork of a fork because I could not find any trace of the original modpack or infomation on why it was removed from practically everything. I plan to release .jar's and this repository will mostly function as an archive and hopefully be kept up to date for new minecraft versions.

I have not been able to contact the original developer however under MIT license this fork should be following all the rules.

A 1.18.2 Fabric Mod that focuses on expanding content surrounding the mysterious Illagers in Minecraft!

~~Please see the [installation](https://github.com/OhDricky/Illager-Expansion/wiki/Installation) page for information on how to install the mod.\
